# Deploy the usage-count endpoint (~15 minutes, $0 at current scale)

The worker runs on Cloudflare's free tier (100,000 requests/day — far beyond
these apps' needs for years). It stores **daily aggregate counters only**:
no identifiers, no per-install rows, and no IP address is ever read, stored,
or forwarded by our code — the country code arrives pre-derived at
Cloudflare's edge (`request.cf.country`). That guarantee is architectural.

The same worker also serves the **community graph page at its root** — the
public, shareable URL showing the live daily-actives chart, country mix, and
download/share buttons. That URL is what the in-app "Share AutoCommand"
button copies.

## One-time setup

```powershell
# 1. Cloudflare account (free): https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
# 2. Node.js 18+ installed, then in this folder:
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login

# 3. Create the D1 database
wrangler d1 create usage-ping
#    → copy the `database_id` it prints into wrangler.toml

# 4. Initialize the schema (one table)
wrangler d1 execute usage-ping --remote --file=schema.sql

# 5. Set the single secret (paste any long random string when prompted)
wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN

# 6. Deploy
wrangler deploy
#    → prints your URL, e.g. https://autocommand-usage-ping.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

## Wire the client

1. Put the deployed URL into `Services/UsagePingService.cs` → `Endpoint`
   constant in the app (`https://…workers.dev/v1/ping`), and set
   `AppName` (`autocommand` / `shields-up`) per app.
2. Ship it in the same release as the README/PRIVACY.md changes (see
   `../docs/INTEGRATION.md`).

## Day-to-day

> **Automated:** `powershell -File snapshot-usage.ps1 -Install` registers a
> weekly scheduled task that snapshots /v1/stats + GitHub downloads into
> `fundraising/metrics/history/` and runs the plausibility anchor. Details:
> `docs/WEEKLY_RITUAL.md`. The manual commands below still work.

```powershell
# Weekly numbers (the investor table):
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" https://<your-worker>/v1/stats

# The community graph page (open in a browser; this is the share URL):
start https://<your-worker>/

# Public daily-actives badge (optional, safe to expose — yesterday's opt-in DAU):
curl https://<your-worker>/v1/badge
```

What you get from `/v1/stats`: daily-active series per app (last 240 days),
country distribution, version adoption (30 days), and totals. There are no
per-user metrics because there are no users in the data — by design.

Save the `/v1/stats` output weekly into `../../fundraising/metrics/` (see
`pull-github-metrics.ps1` for the download-count side) — that becomes the
traction time series for the raise. (Or let `snapshot-usage.ps1 -Install`
do it — see `docs/WEEKLY_RITUAL.md`.)

> **Operational note — fresh deploys:** the smoke tests can false-fail for
> about a minute after the very first deploy (the worker reports deployed
> before the D1 binding has propagated to every edge colo — transient
> 500/404). Re-run the script before diagnosing; it is idempotent. Verified
> live on the first-ever deploy: 5/6 FAILs, then all PASS on re-run with
> zero changes.

## Hardening (5 minutes, one-time)

**Rate-limit the count endpoint** — the one abuse vector left after the
worker's own gates (JSON-only content type kills the browser vector; app
allowlist + field truncation bound what a row can contain). A single IP
flooding `POST /v1/ping` is the remaining way to inflate counts:

1. Cloudflare dash → your domain (the workers.dev zone isn't rate-limited
   from the dash; a custom domain on the worker is) — if you stay on
   `*.workers.dev`, the practical mitigation is the plausibility check below.
2. With a custom domain: Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules →
   expression `(http.request.uri.path eq "/v1/ping")`, e.g. 30 requests / 10
   min / per IP, action Block for 1 hour.

**Plausibility anchor (do this regardless):** counts can never legitimately
exceed downloads. In the weekly snapshot ritual, compare that day's opt-in
DAU against cumulative downloads from `pull-github-metrics.ps1` — a DAU that
explodes past the downloads curve is spoofed, and you annotate it as such in
the data room rather than deleting it. Investigable raw data + methodology
beats silently "fixed" numbers.

**Token hygiene:**
- The Cloudflare API token: scope it to the one account; delete it after
  setup (re-create when you redeploy).
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` rotation: generate a new value, then
  `wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN`, update `admin-token.txt`. It only
  guards reads of anonymous aggregates, but rotate it like any credential.
- Never commit `admin-token.txt` (gitignored) and never paste it in
  screenshots or issues.

**If the endpoint is ever abused:** you can null-route the abuse cheaply —
deploy with `ALLOWED_APPS` emptied (worker rejects everything, page keeps
rendering history) while you investigate. No user data is at risk in any
scenario; the database only ever held aggregates.
